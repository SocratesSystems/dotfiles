My dotfiles and stuff I want to automate whenever I decide reformatting my machine is a good idea. Love that fresh OS Smell.

Shoutout to the following repositories:

* [18F/laptop](https://github.com/18F/laptop) - For providing the mac script I used to provision 
* [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) - For providing the original mac script 18F/laptop uses
* [prezto](https://github.com/zsh-users/prezto) - I will forever mispell this as pretzo

Supposedly simple setup for macOS:

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SocratesSystems/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```
